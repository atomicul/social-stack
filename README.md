# Social Stack
Blazingly fast open-source social links index page

* ‚ö° Builds into a static HTML page
* üö´ Very few dependencies for building; relies heavily on core GNU/Linux utils
* ‚òÅÔ∏è Can be built, dockerized, and deployed to GitHub Pages with CI/CD Actions,
just fork the repo and modify the configs
* ‚öôÔ∏è Easily configurable; a single YAML file holds all build options

## Configuring
Tweak `build-options.yml` to customize your page; this example configuration is
available [here](https://atomicul.github.io/social-stack).

Assets must be stored in `src/assets`, and they should be referenced either with
an absolute path, i.e., `/<ASSET>`, or with a relative path, i.e., `./<ASSET>`, both
of which refer to the file `src/assets/<ASSET>`.

The `meta-description` property is the one you would set with a `<meta>` tag in
the head section of the HTML document. For better context of the properties, check
out these files: `src/*.html.template`.

You should feel free to modify the templates, but be aware that some properties
are expected to be part of an attribute string (such as `profile-picture`), others
are meant to be text inside of an HTML element (such as `owner-name`), and some
replacements are meant to be substituted as-is (`links` is replaced that way).
Because of this reason, not all properties are sanitized the same way. For a better
understanding of how the build system works, check out `bin/compile-html`.

Themes can be changed in `tailwind.config.js`. Refer to
the [daisyUI](https://v4.daisyui.com/docs/themes) documentation
for details. The example assets are colored specifically for
the 'aqua' theme.

## Building
### GitHub Actions
You can have GitHub build the project for you, publish Docker images, and/or
deploy the project to GitHub Pages.

Instructions below:
1. Fork the repository
2. Enable GitHub Actions
3. Enable deployment to GitHub Pages from Actions (if needed)
4. Make [configuring](#configuring) changes as needed
5. Push the changes to main

This will trigger the workflows in `.github/workflows`, and GitHub will release
and deploy the project for you.

### Docker
Instructions below:
1. Make [configuring](#configuring) changes as needed
2. Build the Docker container: `docker build -t <TAG> .`
3. Run the container: `docker run -it -p '<PORT>:80' <TAG>`

### Build HTML in a Linux shell
Instructions below:
1. Make [configuring](#configuring) changes as needed
2. Install JavaScript build dependencies: `yarn` (requires NodeJS and Yarn)
3. Install [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) the YAML parser
4. Run the build script: `bin/compile-html`

This creates a new directory, `build`, containing the HTML, CSS, and asset files.
